I am a PhD student in Geometry and Mathematical Physics at SISSA
under supervision of Fedor Bogomolov and Lothar Goettsche.
My scientific interests are mainly concentrated on the theory
of Vector bundles on algebraic varieties and algebro-geometric stability.
The themes which are directly connected with my research include:
Metric on vector bundles, families of curves, moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces,
geometry of algebraic surfaces, Higgs bundles, Non-abelian Hodge theory,
Complex varieties.
